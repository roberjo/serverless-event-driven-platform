```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- AWS credentials with admin access

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to the environment directory
cd terraform/environments/dev

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the infrastructure
terraform plan

# Apply the infrastructure
terraform apply
```

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Single AWS account
- Minimal security controls for development
- Cost-optimized resources
- Quick deployment for testing

### Staging Environment
- Mirrors production configuration
- Full security controls
- Performance testing capabilities
- Data sanitization

### Production Environment
- Multi-account setup (if required)
- Maximum security controls
- High availability configuration
- Comprehensive monitoring

## Security Considerations

- All infrastructure is deployed using least privilege principles
- Secrets are managed through AWS Secrets Manager
- Network security is implemented at multiple layers
- Compliance monitoring is enabled by default

## Cost Management

- Resources are tagged for cost allocation
- Auto-scaling is configured for cost optimization
- Reserved instances are used where appropriate
- Cost alerts are configured for budget management
