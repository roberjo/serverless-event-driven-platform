## Monitoring & Observability Overview

### Observability Vision
The monitoring and observability architecture provides comprehensive visibility into the event-driven microservices platform, enabling proactive issue detection, rapid incident response, and data-driven decision making. The architecture follows the three pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Monitoring Principles

#### 1. Observability First
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Monitor all aspects of the system
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous real-time monitoring
- **Proactive Detection**: Detect issues before they impact users
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Make decisions based on monitoring data

#### 2. Three Pillars of Observability
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of system behavior
- **Logs**: Structured event records with context
- **Traces**: Distributed request flow tracking

#### 3. Monitoring Hierarchy
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Hardware, network, and platform metrics
- **Application Monitoring**: Application performance and behavior
- **Business Monitoring**: Business metrics and user experience
- **Security Monitoring**: Security events and threats

#### 4. Monitoring Best Practices
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **SLI/SLO/SLA**: Service level indicators, objectives, and agreements
- **Alerting Strategy**: Meaningful alerts with appropriate thresholds
- **Dashboard Design**: Clear, actionable visualizations
